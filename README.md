# Memory-Remember-Game
An interactive memory card game built with React where players match pairs of cards by flipping them. Includes randomized card shuffling, move counter, score tracking, match detection logic, and smooth UI transitions. Through this project, I practiced managing complex state with React hooks and building responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
